TDG's sync.py
---------------
    If you hate DDNS services like me and want to make your 
own solution for your home server, this project is for you ...

= Requirements

- Python >= 2.6.2

= Optionals

- tweepy (easy_install tweepy 
          git clone https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.git)
- psutil >= 0.4.1
          (wget http://code.google.com/p/psutil/downloads/detail?name=psutil-0.4.1.tar.gz&can=2&q=)
- lm_sensors (use your distro's own package system)

= Install

1. Download it or clone it from here. (https://github.com/tdgunes/tdgsync)

2. If it is a zip archive (unzip) - if you git clone it, you can pass this step :)

3. Edit and customize these files: sync.config, sentences, index.html(all of these file names can change except sync.config)

4. Edit sync.py's sync.config file path.

5. Run "python sync.py start"


= Start this at startup (A bit hard)

Note: I don't have much time to write a system service, until then this should help:

1. Write "sudo -u tdgunes "/home/example/sync.sh" to /etc/rc.local

2. Put sync.sh to your "/home/example/"

3. Edit your sync.sh and change the example path 

- "screen -m -d -S sync python /home/example/sync.py start"

4. Reboot the system, and hope it works :)
